## Custom Images

- Custom Image  Resolution: 140px * 68px (it is also important to rotate the images 90 degrees, so that 140px is the width and 68px the height)
- This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/15t3o6k/custom_art_on_niceview_displays/) was really helpful figuring out how to add custom images.
